Description: 
    `orthogene` is an R package for easy mapping of orthologous genes 
    across hundreds of species. It pulls up-to-date gene ortholog mappings 
    across **700+ organisms**. 
    It also provides various utility functions to aggregate/expand 
    common objects (e.g. data.frames, gene expression matrices, lists) 
    using **1:1**, **many:1**, **1:many** or **many:many** gene mappings, 
    both within- and between-species.
